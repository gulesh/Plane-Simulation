## Main_Idea
For the Final project, I am trying to create a simulator for contrails created by planes. The motivation behind is that we have worked with particles systems and meshes in previous two labs. So, for final project, I am trying to add velocity to the plane and add smoke particles to give a natural look.

## Basic_Features
1. Create particles
2. Upload Plane Models
3. Move Plane using velocity
4. Rotate camera using Mouse
5. Create contrails
6. Zoom in and Zoom out (using keyboard and mouse)

## Additional work
1. Adding sky background to give real look
2. Add texture to the plane

## Timeline
- This week
  -  Set up basic Environment like view window, camera, make files etc.
  -  uploading meshes, creating particles and generating contrails
  -  adding velocity to the plane
  -  Camera Rotation
  -  Zoom in Zoom out
- Next Week
  - Move incomplete task from last week if any
  - work on Additional features
