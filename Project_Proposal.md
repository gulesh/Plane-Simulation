## Main_Idea
For the Final project, I am trying to create a simulator for contrails created by planes. The motivation behind is that we have worked with particles systems and meshes in previous two labs. So, for final project, I am trying to add velocity to the plane and add smoke particles to give a natural look.

## Basic_Features
1. Create particles
2. Upload Plane Models
3. Rotate camera using Mouse
4. Create contrails
5. Zoom in and Zoom out (using keyboard and mouse)
6. Move Plane using velocity

## Additional work
1. Adding sky background to give real look
2. Add texture to the plane
